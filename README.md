## What is go-detour?

**[go-detour][1]** is a [Detour][2], an amazing multi-platform library for
navigation mesh path-finding, to the [Go language][3].


## So what is Detour?

From [Detour][2] README:
> **Detour** is a path-finding and spatial reasoning toolkit. You can use any
> navigation mesh with **Detour**, but of course the data generated with
> **Recast** fits perfectly.

> **Detour** offers simple static navigation mesh which is suitable for many
> simple cases, as well as tiled navigation mesh which allows you to plug in
> and out pieces of the mesh. The tiled mesh allows you to create systems where
> you stream new navigation data in and out as the player progresses the level,
> or you may regenerate tiles as the world changes.
